Description: Provides routines for the generation of response patterns under unidimensional dichotomous and polytomous computerized adaptive testing (CAT) framework. It holds many standard functions to estimate ability, select the first item(s) to administer and optimally select the next item, as well as several stopping rules. Options to control for item exposure and content balancing are also available (Magis and Raiche, Random Generation of Response Patterns under Computerized Adaptive Testing with the R Package catR, Journal of Statistical Software, 48 (8), 2012, 1-31 <doi:10.18637/jss.v048.i08>).
