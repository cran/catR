- Changes in catR 1.2 (2010-09-07) -
------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  Several procedures for next item selection have been
     added. First, Maximum Likelihood Weighted Information
     (MLWI) and Maximum Posterior Weighted Information (MPWI)
     are now available. The command 'MWI' has been developed
     for that purpose.

  o  Second, Maximum Expected Information (MEI) has been
     implemented for next item selection. The function 'MEI'
     was developed for computing MEI values.

  o  The MEI criterion required the creation of the 'OIi'
     command for computing observed information function. 

  o  The Maximum Expected Posterior Variance (MEPV) is also
     available. The command 'EPV' computes expected posterior
     variances and is used within the 'nextItem' function.

  o  Finally, the completely random selection of the next 
     item is also possible right now.

  o  The functions 'eapEst' and 'eapSem' have been modified
     to speed up their computation. The approximation of the
     integrals is now made by the 'integrate.xy' function 
     from the package 'sfsmisc'.

  o  The function 'startItems' has been modified. First, the
     argument 'bw' has been replaced by 'halfRange' and codes
     now for the half range of the sequence and not the full
     range (this was misleading). Second, the items can be
     selected either according to their difficulty level or
     their information function. This is specified by the
     'startSelect' argument.

  o  Consequently, the functions 'nextItem', 'testList', 
     'randomCAT' and 'print.cat' have been updated.


MINOR UPDATES

  o  The argument 'eapPar' from functions 'eapEst' and 'eapSem'
     has been renamed to 'parInt' for consistency with the 
     'MWI' and 'nextItem' functions. It better refers to the
     parameters for numerical integration and not only for the
     EAP method, but also for MLWI and MPWI computation. 

  o  Several typos have been fixed in the help manual.

  o  The 'plot.cat' function has been modified. Now, the 
     confidence intervals do not appear by default ('ci=FALSE'
     in the code). Moreover, confidence intervals are displayed
     with dotted traits, while the true ability level is drawn
     with a solid horizontal line. Also, any classification
     level can be specified and drawn by a dashed horizontal
     trait.

MAJOR UPDATES

  o  Owen's procedure has been added as a method for next item
     selection. 

  o  Consequently, the functions 'nextItem', 'testList', 
     'randomCAT' and 'print.cat' have been updated.
